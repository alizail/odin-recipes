            <img src="">
            <p>This should be a staple for every pasta-loving vegan. It's one of my favorite pasta recipes.</p>
            
            <h3>Ingredients</h3><p>for one serving</p>
            <input type="checkbox"> 56g <strong>fettucine</strong> (or any pasta shape)<br>
            <input type="checkbox"> 5g <strong>olive oil</strong> (or Earth Balance, or any other oil)<br>
            <input type="checkbox"> 5g <strong>flour</strong><br>
            <input type="checkbox"> 200ml <strong>almond milk</strong> (or other plant-based milk)<br>
            <input type="checkbox"> <strong>nutritional yeast, to taste</strong><br>
            <input type="checkbox"> <strong>salt and seasonings, to taste</strong><br>
            <input type="checkbox"> <strong>water</strong><br>
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the pasta.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add olive oil and cook.</li>
                <li>Add flour and mix to create a paste. Cook thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Gradually add milk, a few tablespoons at a time, stirring consistently. Don't add too much milk at one to ensure the sauce maintains a good thickness and doesn't become too runny.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce is at the desired consistency and amount, add nutritional yeast and seasonings to taste.</li>
                <li>Add the sauce to the cooked pasta.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If the sauce becomes too runny, you may be able to save it by patiently waiting for the excess water to cook off.</li>
                <li>If you add too much milk at once, the flour mixture may not emulsify properly and the sauce may have lumps.</li>
            </ul>
